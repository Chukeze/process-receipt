## How To Run
 [-] When running, especially if making a post request, a http request error might occur if so please refer to the validation logic in [receipt.go](./models/receipt.go). Most likely the format you are sending is not what I assumed the format to be or you are sending a non-valid payload.

 [-] You Can run with Curl, Docker, or Postman. There are local unit test here that can be ran too
